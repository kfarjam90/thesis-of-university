One of the most important aspects of business is advertising. For many years, it has played a critical role in shaping business success. Although methods of advertising have evolved over time, its importance remains unchanged.
In the past, companies relied on traditional media such as billboards, newspapers, magazines, and radio to promote their products and increase revenue. However, with the advent of technology and the internet, advertising strategies have undergone significant shifts. Nowadays, most people spend a considerable amount of time online, engaging in activities ranging from studying to paying bills. To align with this shift—and contribute to environmental conservation by reducing paper usage—digital advertising has become the preferred choice.
In our goal is to predict whether users will click on advertisements. To achieve this, we aim to build a predictive model that accurately determines whether an advertisement was clicked (ad_clicked). We are provided with a folder containing CSV files that track user activity on the webpage.
Given the limitations of this project, we must apply two filters: first, include only users who spent at least 5 seconds on the site. Second, use only the first 5 seconds of cursor movement data to predict whether a user clicked on an ad (ad_clicked). This approach ensures that users did not land on the site accidentally. For the final dataset intended for modeling, certain features such as age, income, gender, attention, and education will need to be dropped. These features will be retained for exploratory data analysis (EDA) but will be excluded afterward to focus on the most relevant variables for prediction.
This approach can reveal two possibilities, the advertisement may have been highly attractive, prompting the user to click within 5 seconds, or the user may have clicked on the ad accidentally. Both scenarios provide valuable insights to help us achieve our objective of understanding and optimizing user engagement with advertisements.
For the models Using classifier algorithms is better for predicting ad clicks because target variable (ad_clicked) is a binary classification problem (values typically represented as 0 for "no click" and 1 for "clicked").
